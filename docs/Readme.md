## Purpose of the Documentation

The primary purpose of the documentation folder is to centralize all written reports and instructions. The documentation provides a detailed description of the project setup, execution, and results. This section aims to help stakeholders understand the project’s objectives, methodology, and conclusions.

This README file will help users navigate the `docs/` directory and understand the purpose of each file.

## Project Report Overview

The `project_report.docx` file provides a comprehensive summary of the project. It includes:

- **Project Overview**: Brief introduction to the project's purpose and objectives.
- **Methodology**: A breakdown of the data collection, analysis techniques, and SQL scripts utilized for analysis.
- **Findings and Results**: Summarized results from SQL queries and analyses conducted as part of the project.
- **Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and tables to support the findings.
- **Conclusion**: A summary of the results and any recommendations for further exploration.

This report is generated dynamically using a Python script (`create_doc.py`) from the `scripts/` directory.

## Generating the Project Report

To generate the `project_report.docx` file, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure the Required Python Packages are Installed**: You will need packages such as `docx` and `pandas`. Install them by running:

    ```bash
    pip install python-docx pandas
    ```

2. **Verify the Configuration File (`iconfig.ini`)**: Make sure the configuration file in the `config/` directory is set up correctly with the output paths and any other relevant settings.

3. **Run the `create_doc.py` Script**:

    Navigate to the `scripts/` directory and execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python create_doc.py
    ```

    This script will use your project’s data and configuration settings to generate the report. The resulting file will be saved as `project_report.docx` within the `docs/` folder.

4. **Review and Edit**: After the report is generated, open `project_report.docx` in your preferred text editor (such as MS Word or Google Docs) to review it. You can make final adjustments or add additional information if required.

## Modifying Documentation Files

If you need to update or add information to the documentation:

1. **Editing `README.md`**: Use any Markdown editor to open and edit this `README.md` file. Include additional sections or instructions as the project evolves.

2. **Updating the Project Report (`project_report.docx`)**: 
   - If the `project_report.docx` template or structure needs modification, update the script `create_doc.py` to include additional sections, styles, or formatting options.
   - Ensure that any changes to the underlying data analysis or SQL scripts are reflected in the report generation script.

3. **Adding New Files to the `docs/` Directory**: If you plan to include more documentation-related files in the `docs/` directory, make sure to update this `README.md` file with descriptions of those files.

## Future Updates

As the project progresses or new findings are made, you may need to update the documentation to reflect changes in:

- **Data Analysis Methods**: If new SQL scripts are introduced or analysis techniques are modified, update the project report generation script.
- **Configuration Settings**: Keep the `config/` directory updated to ensure the report generation script and other documentation files use the latest settings.

**Note:** Always commit any significant changes to your version control system (like GitHub) to keep track of the project’s evolution.
